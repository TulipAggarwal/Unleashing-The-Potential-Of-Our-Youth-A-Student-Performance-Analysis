The quality of a country's education system is widely regarded as a critical measure of its overall development and progress. Over time, the education sector has undergone significant transformations and is now recognized as an industry in its own right. However, like any other industry, it faces numerous challenges, particularly in the realm of higher education. Two prominent challenges in this context are the declining success rates of students and the increasing number of students who leave their courses without completion.

One essential aspect of teaching is the analysis of student work. Teachers constantly assign, collect, and examine student work to evaluate their learning progress and make necessary adjustments to their teaching methods. This ongoing assessment of student learning enables teachers to engage in continuous quality improvement of their courses, ensuring that students receive the best possible education.

When analyzing student performance, it is crucial to consider various factors that can influence their academic outcomes. One such factor is the educational background of the students' parents. Research has shown that parental education plays a significant role in shaping a child's academic achievement. Students with parents who have higher levels of education tend to have better educational outcomes due to factors like increased support, higher expectations, and access to resources.

Another factor that can impact student performance is the status of test preparation. Students who undergo dedicated test preparation courses or engage in effective study techniques often have an advantage in exams. These courses provide strategies, resources, and practice materials to enhance students' understanding of the subject matter and their performance in assessments.

By analyzing a dataset containing the marks secured by 1000 students from a school, this project aims to explore and establish correlations between student performance and various attributes. The analysis seeks to understand the influence of factors like parental level of education and test preparation on students' performance in exams. By uncovering these relationships, educators and policymakers can gain valuable insights into the factors that contribute to student success and take proactive measures to address challenges in the education system.
